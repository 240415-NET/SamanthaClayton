# Samantha's Project 1 Proposal

## Overview
Meal planning app that allows the user to plan their meals for a week and then creates a grocery list based on that meal plan

## Ideas

### Weekly Meal Plan
- Displays an autogenerated meal plan to the user
- User can modify the meal plan (select different meals)

### Meal Database
 - Pre-loaded meals
 - User can add additional meals to the database

 ### Grocery List
 - Grocery list is generated based on the meals selected
 - User can modify the list as needed

 ## User Stories/Features
 - Done: As a user, I want to be able to create a profile and log in
    - Main menu that allows a user to choose to create a new profile or log in to an existing one
    - Use their selection to
        - Create a new profile & store it
        - Log in
- Done: As a user, I want to be able to view the weekly meal plan
    - Create and display a meal plan from a pre-loaded list of meals
- Done: As a user, I want to be able to save my weekly meal plan & load it later
- As a user, I want to view my grocery list
    - When a new meal plan is generated
    - Also when I log in later
- Change to SQL
- Unit tests

**Nice to have:**
- As a user, I want to be able to modify the weekly meal plan
- As a user, I want to be able to add new meals/recipes
- Add a grocery item type so I can separate the grocery list by area of store
- Aa a user, I want to view a recipe


**Other thoughts**
- Should I add a recipe Id?
- Modify the ToString for MealPlans class to display the meal plan instead of handling it in the MealPlanUI.cs


## Models
- Users
    - userId (int)
    - userName (string)

# Samantha's Project 1 Proposal

## Overview
Meal planning app that allows the user to plan their meals for a week and then creates a grocery list based on that meal plan

## Key Functionality
- Displays an autogenerated meal plan to the user (from a list of pre-loaded meals)
- User can modify the meal plan (select different meals)
- User can store the meal plan & come back to it later
- User can view grocery list based off the meal plan


 ### Grocery List
 - Grocery list is generated based on the meals selected

 ## User Stories/Features/To Do Items
 - Done: As a user, I want to be able to create a profile and log in
    - Main menu that allows a user to choose to create a new profile or log in to an existing one
    - Use their selection to
        - Create a new profile & store it
        - Log in
- Done: As a user, I want to be able to view the weekly meal plan
    - Create and display a meal plan from a pre-loaded list of meals
- Done: As a user, I want to be able to save my weekly meal plan & load it later
- Done: As a user, I want to view my grocery list
    - When a new meal plan is generated
    - Also when I log in later
- Change to SQL
- Unit tests
- As a user, I want to be able to modify the weekly meal plan
    - Select day to change
    - View all meals -or- randomly generate a new one?
- Change to a DTO?
- Repeat menus
- Modify the ToStrings for 
    - MealPlans class to display the meal plan instead of handling it in the MealPlanUI.cs
    - GroceryList class
    - GroceryItem class



**Other Ideas (non-MVP) (drafts)**
- Aa a user, I want to view a recipe
- As a user, I want to be able to add new meals/recipes
- As a user, I want to be able to 'rate' (or just 'blacklist') certain meals so they never show up in my meal plan
- Add a grocery item type so I can separate the grocery list by area of store
    - Could just add a 'category' attribute to the grocery item class OR
    - Produce, Raw Meat, Deli, Spices, Dairy, Oils, Sauces could all be subclasses of Grocery Items
        - In Raw Meat, could have extra info like "grass fed"
        - In Deli, could have a method to convert 'slices' to ounces
        - OR could just have Meats and have pre-cooked vs. cooked that later warns a user when they're cooking that pre-work is involved
        - Processed food could have attributes like glutenfree or dairyfree

# Samantha's Project 1 Proposal

## Big Ideas
1. **Morbid** - An app for planning after death stuff (insurance policies, any assets & who they go to, accounts/passwords, funeral arrangements, letters to your family, etc.)
2. **Grocery List (Taylor's Version (Sam's Version))** Have the ability to add meals, which then automatically compile all ingredients into a grocery shopping list for the week.  Recipes would have labels (gf, df, <30 minutes, etc.).  Meal plan would be automatically generated, but the user can pick something new.  Rate meals based on whether you want to see them more/less frequently.  Maybe even a "hyperfixation meal" label that makes the meal show up every week.  Could also expand to include other "to do" type items, so it's a plan for the whole week.

# Samantha's Project 1 Proposal

## Big Ideas
1. **Morbid** - An app for planning after death stuff (insurance policies, any assets & who they go to, accounts/passwords, funeral arrangements, letters to your family, etc.)
2. **Grocery List** Have the ability to add meals, which then automatically compile all ingredients into a grocery shopping list for the week.  Recipes would have labels (gf, df, <30 minutes, etc.).  Meal plan would be automatically generated, but the user can pick something new.  Rate meals based on whether you want to see them more/less frequently.  Maybe even a "hyperfixation meal" label that makes the meal show up every week.  Could also expand to include other "to do" type items, so it's a plan for the whole week.
3. **Real Housewives Trvia/Bracket/Bingo Game** Admins add the questions, answers, and correct answer.  Users watch weekly and answer the questions.  They can create profiles, their scores are added up each week, and there are different rankings.  Could have public rankings vs. within an individual friend group.

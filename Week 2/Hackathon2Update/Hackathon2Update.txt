Overall goal:  Refactor Hackathon2 to use classes & lists

1. Create a class to model some sort of object
2. Prompt the user for values for that object
3. Use these values to create objects that we define (maybe use a constructor)
4. Store them in a list (or an array)
5. Handle the exceptions during the running of the application (no hard crashing)
6. Want to be able to create, modify, & delete values for our objects store in a list
7. Continue to run until the user quits the application (no CTRL+C)

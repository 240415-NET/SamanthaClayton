Cosmetic/cool:
1) Clear console/formatting stuff
2) Ways to cancel an action (like when you go to the remove menu, have a "back to main menu" option)
3) Validation for every menu that takes in the user input and then the possible values and figures out if itâ€™s valid or not then outputs a display message
4) Check out other people's grocery list apps to learn
5) Maybe look into what Brian did re: "using classes to organize your UI"


Practicing what we learned in class:
1) Add a GroceryList class & edit it's ToString()
2) Practice general method overloading & general method overriding
3) Make GroceryList a parent of GroceryItem?  Or find a way to make a parent/child
    - Practice parent:child constructors, including constructor overloading
    - Practice parent:child method overriding
    - Practice parent:child method overloading

More of what we learned in class:
1) Add in user creation
2) Add in storage of the list
